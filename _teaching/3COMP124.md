## COMP124 - Computer Systems

- Period: Week 3 - Week 9 in 2021-22 Second Semester
- Module  lecturer: [Dr Stuart Thomason](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/stuart-thomason/)
- Location: George Holt Building, 7 Ashton St, Liverpool, L69 3GJ, England

## Main duties and responsibilities:

1. Prepare the content

   The lecturer sends the materials that will be used each week in advance. When I receive the materials, I study them prior to preparing to answer the students' questions

2. Leading the Lab sessions each week.

   I will demonstrate how to find the materials needed for the session in Canvas and then inform students about the exercises.

3. Assistance, evaluation of student codes in real time

   I encourage active asking of questions. I walk around the lab after students have started practising. To answer questions that students encounter.

   I also check the students' code during the last half of the lab to ensure that every student can keep up with the progress

## What I have learned

1. Effective communication skills

   In this module, I often communicate with the lecturer and other teaching assistants, and I am also involved in answering students' questions. This has enhanced my ability to explain complex concepts clearly.
