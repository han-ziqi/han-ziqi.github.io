Today I'm going to practice Python linked list. LeetCode 203. 707. 206.

### Knowledge of linked list

Before we begin, let's review some of the knowledge points of chained tables.

#### What is a linked list

  1. Definition: **linked list** is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) to the next. It is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) consisting of a collection of [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)) which together represent a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence).

 2. Advantages: the construction of sequential tables need to predict the size of the data to apply for continuous storage space, the expansion of data migration is required, the use of inflexible, Linked lists make full use of computer memory space to achieve flexible memory dynamic management.

#### Singly linked list

1. Definition: A singly linked list is the simplest form of a linked table, each node of which contains two domains - the information domain (element domain) and the link domain. The link points to the next node in the chain table, while the link field of the last node points to a null value.

`head` stores the first address, `elem` stores the data, and `next` points to the next node address.

#### Doubly linked list

In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous').

### Question 1

[203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)

>Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Idea: There are two types of chained list: empty and non-empty linked list. For non-empty linked list, the operation of the first node is different from the one after it. And add a dummy node in front of the head node, so that the head node can become the same as the following nodes.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next = head)
        cur = dummy
        while cur.next!=None:
            if cur.next.val == val:
                cur.next = cur.next.next
            else:
                cur = cur.next
 
        return dummy.next
```

### Question 2

[707. Design Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)

> Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
> A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
> If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        
class MyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dummy_head = ListNode()
        self.size = 0
 
    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return -1
        
        current = self.dummy_head.next
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
            
        return current.val
 
    def addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.dummy_head.next = ListNode(val, self.dummy_head.next)
        self.size += 1
 
    def addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:
        current = self.dummy_head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        self.size += 1
 
    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return
        
        current = self.dummy_head
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
        current.next = ListNode(val, current.next)
        self.size += 1
 
    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return
        
        current = self.dummy_head
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
        current.next = current.next.next
        self.size -= 1
        
 
 
# Your MyLinkedList object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyLinkedList()
# param_1 = obj.get(index)
# obj.addAtHead(val)
# obj.addAtTail(val)
# obj.addAtIndex(index,val)
# obj.deleteAtIndex(index)
```



### Question 3

> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.

Just change the point of the next pointer in the linked list , and invert it directly , no need to redefine a new linked list .

The two-pointer method can be done

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        cur = head   
        pre = None
        while cur:
            temp = cur.next 
            cur.next = pre 
            pre = cur
            cur = temp
        return pre
```
