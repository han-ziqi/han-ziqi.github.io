The last day of greedy algorithm practice!

### Question 1

[738. Monotone Increasing Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/)

> An integer has **monotone increasing digits** if and only if each pair of adjacent digits `x` and `y` satisfy `x <= y`.
>
> Given an integer `n`, return *the largest number that is less than or equal to* `n` *with **monotone increasing digits***.

It looks like brute force method can do it, but it will timeout.

With back-to-front traversal, the local optimum can be pushed out to the global optimum, just right for using greed.

```python
class Solution:
    def monotoneIncreasingDigits(self, n: int) -> int:
        strNum = str(n)
        flag = len(strNum)
        for i in range(len(strNum) - 1, 0, -1):
          
            if strNum[i - 1] > strNum[i]:
                flag = i  
                strNum = strNum[:i - 1] + str(int(strNum[i - 1]) - 1) + strNum[i:]
     
        for i in range(flag, len(strNum)):
            strNum = strNum[:i] + '9' + strNum[i + 1:]
        return int(strNum)
```

### Question 2

[968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

> You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
>
> Return *the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree*.

Place the camera at the position of the parent node of the leaf node in order to make full use of the coverage area of the camera.

Local optimum: let the parent node of the leaf node plant the camera with the least number of cameras used, and overall optimum: the least number of cameras used for the entire number of cameras! This is still the solution to the greedy algorithm.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        result = [0] 
        if self.traversal(root, result) == 0:
            result[0] += 1
 
        return result[0]
 
        
    def traversal(self, cur: TreeNode, result: List[int]) -> int:
        if not cur:
            return 2
 
        left = self.traversal(cur.left, result)
        right = self.traversal(cur.right, result)
 
        if left == 2 and right == 2:
            return 0
 
        elif left == 0 or right == 0:
            result[0] += 1
            return 1
 
 
        else:
            return 2
```
