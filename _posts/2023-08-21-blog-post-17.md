It is not very easy, but it is important to understand how to think when you use recursion, and not to get sidetracked.

### Question 1

[654. Maximum Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/)

> You are given an integer array `nums` with no duplicates. A **maximum binary tree** can be built recursively from `nums` using the following algorithm:
>
> 1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in `nums`.
> 2. Recursively build the left subtree on the **subarray prefix** to the **left** of the maximum value.
> 3. Recursively build the right subtree on the **subarray suffix** to the **right** of the maximum value.
>
> Return *the **maximum binary tree** built from* `nums`.

Whenever we solve questions about constructing a binary tree , we can use a preorder traversal (middle → left  → right). The root node is constructed first, and then the left and right subtrees are constructed.

```python
class Solution:
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return TreeNode(nums[0])
        node = TreeNode(0)
        maxValue = 0
        maxValueIndex = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > maxValue:
                maxValue = nums[i]
                maxValueIndex = i
        node.val = maxValue
        # left
        if maxValueIndex > 0:
            new_list = nums[:maxValueIndex]
            node.left = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(new_list)
        # Right
        if maxValueIndex < len(nums) - 1:
            new_list = nums[maxValueIndex+1:]
            node.right = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(new_list)
        return node
```





### Question 2

[617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)

> You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.
>
> Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.
>
> Return *the merged tree*.
>
> **Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

It's a bit fantastic that two binary trees need to be traversed at the same time.

This problem continues with the recursive three-step process:

1. Determine the parameters and return value of the recursive function:
   1. Pass in the root node of the two binary trees and return the root node of the merged tree.

2. Determine the termination condition
   1. If one of the two trees is null, return the other tree

3. Determine the logic of single level recursion
   1. Merge left subtree with left subtree, right subtree with right subtree

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root1: 
            return root2
        if not root2: 
            return root1
        root1.val += root2.val # 中
        root1.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left) # Left
        root1.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right) # right
        
        return root1 
```



### Question 3

[700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

> You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.
>
> Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

Still applying the three steps of recursion and solving the problem in a recursive way

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if  not root or root.val == val:
            return root
 
        if root.val > val:
            return self.searchBST(root.left,val)
 
        if root.val < val:
            return self.searchBST(root.right,val)
```



### Question 4

[98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.
>
> A **valid BST** is defined as follows:
>
> - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

In a medium-order traversal, the values of the output binary search tree nodes are ordered sequences.

With this property, verifying a binary search tree becomes equivalent to determining whether a sequence is incremental or not.

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vec = []
 
    def traversal(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return
        self.traversal(root.left)
        self.vec.append(root.val)  # Transfer to array
        self.traversal(root.right)
 
    def isValidBST(self, root):
        self.vec = []  
        self.traversal(root)
        for i in range(1, len(self.vec)):
      
            if self.vec[i] <= self.vec[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True
```
