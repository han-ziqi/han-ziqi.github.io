Started the third day of practice, after I positive, the fever, sore throat all experienced, but the studies still continue!

### Question 1

[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

> Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return *a list of all **unique combinations** of* `candidates` *where the chosen numbers sum to* `target`*.* You may return the combinations in **any order**.
>
> The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the 
>
> frequency
>
>  of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
>
> 
>
> The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

The number in candidates can be picked an unlimited number of times, as long as it comes up to traget. It's still solved by recursion.

```python
class Solution:
    def backtracking(self, candidates, target, total, startIndex, path, result):
        if total > target:
            return
        if total == target:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
 
        for i in range(startIndex, len(candidates)):
            total += candidates[i]
            path.append(candidates[i])
            self.backtracking(candidates, target, total, i, path, result)  
            total -= candidates[i]
            path.pop()
 
    def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        result = []
        self.backtracking(candidates, target, 0, 0, [], result)
        return result
```



### Question 2

[40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)

>Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.
>
>Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in the combination.
>
>**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

This question is more restrictive than the previous one: it can only be used once in the candidates, but this time there are duplicate numbers in the candidates

```python
class Solution:
    def backtracking(self, candidates, target, total, startIndex, path, result):
        if total == target:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
 
        for i in range(startIndex, len(candidates)):
            if i > startIndex and candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]:
                continue
 
            if total + candidates[i] > target:
                break
 
            total += candidates[i]
            path.append(candidates[i])
            self.backtracking(candidates, target, total, i + 1, path, result)
            total -= candidates[i]
            path.pop()
 
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates, target):
        result = []
        candidates.sort()
        self.backtracking(candidates, target, 0, 0, [], result)
        return result
```



### Question 3

[131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

>Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**. Return *all possible palindrome partitioning of* `s`.

This question is a bit complicated, you need to consider different ways of splitting, as well as determining whether it is a palindrome or not. I couldn't figure out how to write it using a for loop, so I had to look at other people's solutions:

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = []
        self.backtracking(s, 0, [], result)
        return result
    def backtracking(self, s, start_index, path, result ):
        # Base Case
        if start_index == len(s):
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(start_index, len(s)):
            
            if self.is_palindrome(s, start_index, i):
                path.append(s[start_index:i+1])
                self.backtracking(s, i+1, path, result)  
                path.pop()             
    def is_palindrome(self, s: str, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        i: int = start        
        j: int = end
        while i < j:
            if s[i] != s[j]:
                return False
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return True 
```
