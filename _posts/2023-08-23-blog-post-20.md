Last Day of Binary Tree, I think it deserve me to review soon

### Question 1

[669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

> Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.
>
> Return *the root of the trimmed binary search tree*. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

In fact, trimming means that all the nodes in the BST are removed by keeping only the numbers in the range [low, high] and removing everything else. But more than one node may be removed, so the binary tree needs to be reconstructed.

This can be solved by using recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root is None:
            return None
        if root.val < low:
            return self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        if root.val > high:
            return self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)  # left 
        root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)  # right 
        return root
```

### Question 2

[108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

> Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert *it to a* ***height-balanced\*** *binary search tree*.

It should be noted that this question requires height-balanced. If it didn't, it would be pointless to construct the tree as a column.

When constructing a binary tree from an array, the essence is to find the split point, which is the current node, and then recursively left and right intervals.

```python
class Solution:
    def traversal(self, nums: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> TreeNode:
        if left > right:
            return None
        
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        root.left = self.traversal(nums, left, mid - 1)
        root.right = self.traversal(nums, mid + 1, right)
        return root
    
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        root = self.traversal(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)
        return root
```

### Question 3

[538. Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)

> Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
>
> As a reminder, a *binary search tree* is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
>
> - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

This process of accumulation is an inverse-medium order traversal, and figuring out the process makes the questions a little easier.

```python
class Solution:
    def convertBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        self.pre = 0  
        self.traversal(root)
        return root
    def traversal(self, cur):
        if cur is None:
            return        
        self.traversal(cur.right)
        cur.val += self.pre
        self.pre = cur.val
        self.traversal(cur.left)
```
