The first day of binary tree, including basic knowledge and some method of iteration a binary tree.

### 1. Basic knowledge of binary tree

#### 1.1 Types of binary trees

- full binary tree

A **full** binary tree (sometimes referred to as a **proper** or **plane** or **strict** binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

When k is the number of levels, the number of nodes in a full binary tree is 2^k -1

- Complete binary tree

A **complete** binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, *except possibly the last*, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

- binary search tree (BST)

is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree. 

-  self-balancing binary search tree (aka AVL tree)

the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; 

Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log *n*) time in both the average and worst cases.



#### 1.2 Methods for storing binary trees

Binary trees can be

- Chained storage
- Linear storage.

Chained storage is done with pointers and linear storage is done with arrays.

Linear storage has elements distributed continuously in memory, whereas chained storage uses pointers to connect nodes distributed at various addresses.



#### 1.3 Traversal of binary tree

- Depth-first order
  - Pre-order traversal (recursive, iterative)
  - In-order traversal (recursive, iterative)
  - Post-order traversal (recursive, iterative)
-  Breadth-first order
  - level-order traversal (iterative)

#### 1.4 Implement a binary tree

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left = None, right = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```



### 2 Recursive traversal of binary trees (LeetCode 144. 145. 94.)

To avoid getting stuck when writing recursion, consider the following three-step process:

1. **Determine the parameters and return value of the recursive function**: Determine which parameters need to be dealt with in the recursive process, then add this parameter in the recursive function, and also to determine the return value of each recursion to determine the return type of the recursive function.
2. **Determine the termination conditions**: After writing the recursive algorithm, when running, often encountered stack overflow error, is not written termination conditions or termination conditions written incorrectly, the operating system is also a stack structure to save each layer of recursive information, if the recursion is not terminated, the operating system's memory stack will inevitably be overflowed.
3. **Determine the logic of a single level of recursion**: Determine the information that needs to be processed at each level of recursion. Here too, the call itself is repeated to implement the recursion.

Exercise LC144

[144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the preorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

```python
class Solution:
    def preorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        if not root:
            return []
        
        left = self.preorderTraversal(root.left)
        right = self.preorderTraversal(root.right)
        result = [root.val] + left + right # PreOrder: middle + left + right
        return result
```

Exercise LC 145

[145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the postorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

```python
class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        if not root:
            return []
        
        left = self.postorderTraversal(root.left)
        right = self.postorderTraversal(root.right)
        result = left + right + [root.val]
        return result
```

Exercise LC 94

[94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the inorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        if not root:
            return []
        left = self.inorderTraversal(root.left)
        right = self.inorderTraversal(root.right)
 
        result = left + [root.val] + right
        return result
```



### 3. Iterative traversal of binary trees

The non-recursive method is to use a stack. Be careful: although the preorder traversal, is the middle left and right, but into the stack when the first right child node, so as to ensure that out of the stack is the left child node first out.

[144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

```python
class Solution:
    def preorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        if not root:
            return []
        stack = [root]
        result = []
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            # Operate middle node
            result.append(node.val)
            # right child enter stack first
            if node.right:
                stack.append(node.right)
            # left child enter stack later
            if node.left:
                stack.append(node.left)
        return result
```

[145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

```python
class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
           return []
        stack = [root]
        result = []
        while stack:
           node = stack.pop()
           # Operate middle first
           result.append(node.val)
           # left child enter stack first
           if node.left:
               stack.append(node.left)
           # right child enter stack later
           if node.right:
               stack.append(node.right)
        # reverse final array
        return result[::-1]
```

[94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        stack = []  # we can not add root into stack first
        result = []
        cur = root
        while cur or stack:
            # iteration left child fiest
            if cur:     
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left		
            # operate stack top    
            else:		
                cur = stack.pop()
                result.append(cur.val)
                # select right node
                cur = cur.right	
        return result
```



### 4. Unified iterative approach

Put the node you are accessing on the stack, and **put the node you want to process on the stack, but mark it.**

How to mark it? **Is to handle the node into the stack, immediately after the node into a null pointer as a marker.** This method can also be called marking method.
