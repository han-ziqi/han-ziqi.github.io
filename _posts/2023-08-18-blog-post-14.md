The third day of binary tree, Today's exercise covers traversals in different orders.

### Question 1

[104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

>Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
>
>A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

It is important to understand the difference between depth and height before doing this question.

Depth is the distance from any node in a binary tree, to the root node; (Preorder traversal)

Height is the distance from any node in a binary tree, to a leaf node. (Posterior traversal)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        depth = 0
        queue = collections.deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            depth += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
        
        return depth
```



### Question 2

[111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

> Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
>
> The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
>
> Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        depth = 0
        queue = collections.deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            depth += 1 
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    return depth
            
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                    
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
 
        return depth
```



### Question 3

[222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

> Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
>
> According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
>
> Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

Use hierarchical traversal, add a RESULT, count the number of nodes

```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        queue = collections.deque()
        if root:
            queue.append(root)
        result = 0
        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            for i in range(size):
                node = queue.popleft()
                result += 1 #记录节点数量
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
        return result
```
