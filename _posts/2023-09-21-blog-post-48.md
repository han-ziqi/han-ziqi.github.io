Dynamic planning is coming to an end, and I thought it was a lot of content for dynamic planning at the time, but it's finish very quickly.



### Question 1

[583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)

> Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of **steps** required to make* `word1` *and* `word2` *the same*.
>
> In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

This question compared to LC 115, in fact, is that both strings can be deleted, the situation is a little more complex, but the overall idea is the same

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(word2)+1) for _ in range(len(word1)+1)]
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 2, dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)
        return dp[-1][-1]
```



### Question 2

[72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

> Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`*.
>
> You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
>
> - Insert a character
> - Delete a character
> - Replace a character

Edit Distance is a classic problem solved with a dynamic gauge, this problem may look like it's complicated, but the minimum edit distance can be cleverly calculated using a dynamic gauge. Use the five parts of dynamic programming to do an analysis:

1. Determine the dp array (dp table) and what the subscripts mean

dp[i][j] denotes the string word1 ending with subscript i-1, and the string word2 ending with subscript j-1, with the nearest edit distance dp[i][j].

2. Determine the recursive formula

Overall, there are several operations as follows:

```pseudocode
if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
    No operation
if (word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1])
    Insert
    Delete
    Replace
```

 2.1 if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) then it means that without any editing, dp[i][j] should be dp[i - 1][j - 1], i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
 2.2 if (word1[i - 1] ! = word2[j - 1]), then you need to edit, how to edit it?

​	2.2.1 Operation 1: word1 delete an element, then it is the following label i - 2 for the end of the word1 and j-1 for the end of the word2 of the nearest editing distance plus an operation. i.e. dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1;
​	2.2.2 Operation 2: word2 delete an element, then is the subscript i - 1 for the end of the word1 and j-2 for the end of the word2 of the nearest edit distance plus an operation. That is dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1;
​	2.2.3 Operation 3: Replace the element, word1 replace word1[i - 1] to make it the same as word2[j - 1], at this time do not have to add or delete elements.

3. how to initialise dp array

dp[i][j] denotes the string word1 ending with subscript i-1, and the string word2 ending with subscript j-1, with the nearest edit distance dp[i][j].

So what do dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] represent?

dp[i][0] : The string word1 ending with subscript i-1, and the empty string word2, with the nearest edit distance of dp[i][0].

Then dp[i][0] should be i, all the elements in word1 do delete operation, that is: dp[i][0] = i;

Similarly, dp[0][j] = j;

4. determine the traversal order

from the following four recursive formulas:

dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1
It can be seen that dp[i][j] is dependent on the left, top and upper left elements.

5. Derive the dp array by example

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(word2)+1) for _ in range(len(word1)+1)]
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
