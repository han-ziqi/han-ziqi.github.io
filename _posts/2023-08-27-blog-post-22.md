Day before yesterday began suddenly Covid positive, I rest for two days, today no fever continue to study!

[216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

> Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:
>
> - Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
> - Each number is used **at most once**.
>
> Return *a list of all possible valid combinations*. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

The general idea of using recursion is similar to that of the previous question (LC 77).

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []  # save results
        self.backtracking(n, k, 0, 1, [], result)
        return result
 
    def backtracking(self, targetSum, k, currentSum, startIndex, path, result):
        if currentSum > targetSum:  
            return  
        if len(path) == k:
            if currentSum == targetSum:
                result.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(startIndex, 9 - (k - len(path)) + 2):  
            currentSum += i  
            path.append(i)  
            self.backtracking(targetSum, k, currentSum, i + 1, path, result)  
            currentSum -= i  
            path.pop()  
```



[17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)

>Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in **any order**.
>
>A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

It feels like this question has some practical use, but when I think about the nature of it, it's still a recursive solution

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.letterMap = [
            "",     # 0
            "",     # 1
            "abc",  # 2
            "def",  # 3
            "ghi",  # 4
            "jkl",  # 5
            "mno",  # 6
            "pqrs", # 7
            "tuv",  # 8
            "wxyz"  # 9
        ]
        self.result = []
        self.s = ""
    
    def backtracking(self, digits, index):
        if index == len(digits):
            self.result.append(self.s)
            return
        digit = int(digits[index])    
        letters = self.letterMap[digit]    
        for i in range(len(letters)):
            self.s += letters[i]    
            self.backtracking(digits, index + 1)   
            self.s = self.s[:-1]    
    
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        if len(digits) == 0:
            return self.result
        self.backtracking(digits, 0)
        return self.result
```
