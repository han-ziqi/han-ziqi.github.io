Starting day 7 of practice, binary trees are almost done.

### Question 1

[530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

> Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return *the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree*.

The first reaction when I see BST is usually British summer time =_=. Since it is a binary search tree, it is ordered and can be treated as an ordered array.

```python
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        stack = []
        cur = root
        pre = None
        result = float('inf')
 
        while cur is not None or len(stack) > 0:
            if cur is not None:
                stack.append(cur)  
                cur = cur.left  # Left
            else:
                cur = stack.pop()
                if pre is not None:  # Mid
                    result = min(result, cur.val - pre.val)
                pre = cur
                cur = cur.right  # Right
 
        return result
```

### Question 2

[501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)

> Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return *all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it*.
>
> If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.
>
> Assume a BST is defined as follows:
>
> - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
> - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
> - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, cur, freq_map):
        if cur is None:
            return
        freq_map[cur.val] += 1 
        self.searchBST(cur.left, freq_map)
        self.searchBST(cur.right, freq_map)
 
    def findMode(self, root):
        freq_map = defaultdict(int)  # key: element，value: frequency
        result = []
        if root is None:
            return result
        self.searchBST(root, freq_map)
        max_freq = max(freq_map.values())
        for key, freq in freq_map.items():
            if freq == max_freq:
                result.append(key)
        return result
```



### Question 3

[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

It would be great if we could figure out how to do a bottom-up lookup. Exactly corresponds to the idea of backtracking.

A backward traversal (left to right to middle) is a natural backtracking process that can handle the logic of the middle node based on the return values of the left and right subtrees.

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if root == q or root == p or root is None:
            return root
 
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
 
        if left is not None and right is not None:
            return root
 
        if left is None and right is not None:
            return right
        elif left is not None and right is None:
            return left
        else: 
            return None
```
