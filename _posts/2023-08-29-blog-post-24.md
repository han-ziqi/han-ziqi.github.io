Its over half way of backtracking!

### Question 1

[93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

> A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.
>
> - For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are **valid** IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are **invalid** IP addresses.
>
> Given a string `s` containing only digits, return *all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into* `s`. You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

It is still a segmentation type of problem, so the solution is recursive. The problem can still be thought of as a tree structure.

We need the variable startIndex because we can't repeat the split and we need to keep track of where the next level of recursive splitting starts.

We also need the pointNum variable, which records the number of commas added, and is used to determine when the recursion ends.

We can use [startIndex, i] for loop to intercept the substring, and we need to determine whether the substring is legal.

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        self.backtracking(s, 0, 0, "", result)
        return result
 
    def backtracking(self, s, start_index, point_num, current, result):
        if point_num == 3:  
            if self.is_valid(s, start_index, len(s) - 1):  
                current += s[start_index:] 
                result.append(current)
            return
 
        for i in range(start_index, len(s)):
            if self.is_valid(s, start_index, i): 
                sub = s[start_index:i + 1]
                self.backtracking(s, i + 1, point_num + 1, current + sub + '.', result)
            else:
                break
 
    def is_valid(self, s, start, end):
        if start > end:
            return False
        if s[start] == '0' and start != end: 
            return False
        num = 0
        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            if not s[i].isdigit():  
                return False
            num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
            if num > 255:  
                return False
        return True
```

### Question 2

[78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

> Given an integer array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *all possible* 
>
> *subsets* *(the power set)*.
>
> The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

If the process of partitioning this problem, is abstracted to a tree, then what this problem needs is every node of this tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums):
        result = []
        path = []
        self.backtracking(nums, 0, path, result)
        return result
 
    def backtracking(self, nums, startIndex, path, result):
        result.append(path[:])  
        for i in range(startIndex, len(nums)):
            path.append(nums[i])
            self.backtracking(nums, i + 1, path, result)
            path.pop()
```

### Question 3

[90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

> Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return *all possible* 
>
> *subsets* *(the power set)*.
>
> The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

The difference between this question and the previous one is that this one allows for duplicate elements, but the final resultant subset still needs to be de-weighted.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums):
        result = []
        path = []
        nums.sort() 
        self.backtracking(nums, 0, path, result)
        return result
 
    def backtracking(self, nums, startIndex, path, result):
        result.append(path[:])  
        uset = set()
        for i in range(startIndex, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in uset:
                continue
            uset.add(nums[i])
            path.append(nums[i])
            self.backtracking(nums, i + 1, path, result)
            path.pop()
```
