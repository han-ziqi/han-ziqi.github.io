Today, I'm catching up on the progress I left off before Covid Positive. Finishing up the backtracking piece. The questions are all very difficult, so it's good to get a clear idea of what's going on.


### Question 1

[332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

> You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.
>
> All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
>
> - For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
>
> You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

This is a difficult question with some tough spots to work out:

1. A trip with poorly handled flights can easily turn into a loop and become a dead end.
2. How to record the mapping relationship of sorting ?
   1. The mapping relationship of sorting can be solved with hashmap.

I can't do it by myself, I read the code written by others: used array and backtracking solved the problem!

```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        tickets.sort() # To make sure start from smallest lexical order 
        used = [0] * len(tickets)
        path = ['JFK']
        results = []
        self.backtracking(tickets, used, path, 'JFK', results)
        return results[0]
    
    def backtracking(self, tickets, used, path, cur, results):
        if len(path) == len(tickets) + 1:  # End
            results.append(path[:])  
            return True
        
        for i, ticket in enumerate(tickets):  
            if ticket[0] == cur and used[i] == 0:  
                used[i] = 1  
                path.append(ticket[1]) 
                state = self.backtracking(tickets, used, path, ticket[1], results)  
                path.pop()  
                used[i] = 0  
                if state:
                    return True  
```





### Question 2

[51. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

> The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
>
> Given an integer `n`, return *all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle***. You may return the answer in **any order**.
>
> Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

This is a classic puzzle, if n is given a definite value, several finite solutions can be thought of, but n is not given, and it is more complicated when the board area is large. Also converting a two-bit array of boards into a usable array is a challenge.

The following restrictions exist between queens:

- cannot be in the same row
- cannot be in the same column
- cannot be in the same diagonal

The process is still abstracted to traversing the tree and then pruning the unsatisfied conditions.

```python
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = [] 
 
        chessboard = ['.' * n for _ in range(n)]  
        self.backtracking(n, 0, chessboard, result)  
        return [[''.join(row) for row in solution] for solution in result]  
 
    def backtracking(self, n: int, row: int, chessboard: List[str], result: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        if row == n:
            result.append(chessboard[:]) 
            return
 
        for col in range(n):
            if self.isValid(row, col, chessboard):
                chessboard[row] = chessboard[row][:col] + 'Q' + chessboard[row][col+1:]  # place Queen
                self.backtracking(n, row + 1, chessboard, result)  
                chessboard[row] = chessboard[row][:col] + '.' + chessboard[row][col+1:]  
 
    def isValid(self, row: int, col: int, chessboard: List[str]) -> bool:
 
        for i in range(row):
            if chessboard[i][col] == 'Q':
                return False  
 
 
        i, j = row - 1, col - 1
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if chessboard[i][j] == 'Q':
                return False  
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
 
 
        i, j = row - 1, col + 1
        while i >= 0 and j < len(chessboard):
            if chessboard[i][j] == 'Q':
                return False 
            i -= 1
            j += 1
 
        return True 
```





### Question 3

[37. Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)

> Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
>
> A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:
>
> 1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
> 2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
> 3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.
>
> The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

The difficulty with this question is the two-dimensional recursion.

There are three dimensions to determine if the board is legal as follows:

- Whether the same row is duplicated
- Whether the same column is duplicated
- Whether the nine palindromes are duplicated

```python
class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        self.backtracking(board)
 
    def backtracking(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(board)): 
            for j in range(len(board[0])):  
 
                if board[i][j] != '.': continue
                for k in range(1, 10):
                    if self.is_valid(i, j, k, board):
                        board[i][j] = str(k)
                        if self.backtracking(board): return True
                        board[i][j] = '.'
                return False
        return True 
 
    def is_valid(self, row: int, col: int, val: int, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # If conflict in one line
        for i in range(9):
            if board[row][i] == str(val):
                return False
        # If conflict in one row
        for j in range(9):
            if board[j][col] == str(val):
                return False
        # If conflict in one 9 x 9
        start_row = (row // 3) * 3
        start_col = (col // 3) * 3
        for i in range(start_row, start_row + 3):
            for j in range(start_col, start_col + 3):
                if board[i][j] == str(val):
                    return False
        return True
```
