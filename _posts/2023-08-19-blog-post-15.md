Still focus on binary tree.

### Question 1

[110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

> Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**

height-balanced is defined as a binary tree in which the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is no more than one.

Since we are comparing heights, we need to do a backward traversal.

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
 
        height_map = {}
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if node:
                stack.append(node)
                stack.append(None)
                if node.left: stack.append(node.left)
                if node.right: stack.append(node.right)
            else:
                real_node = stack.pop()
                left, right = height_map.get(real_node.left, 0), height_map.get(real_node.right, 0)
                if abs(left - right) > 1:
                    return False
                height_map[real_node] = 1 + max(left, right)
        return True
```



### Question 2

[257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *all root-to-leaf paths in **any order***.
>
> A **leaf** is a node with no children.

This question involves backtracking, because we want to record the paths, and we need to backtrack to go back one path and enter another.

It also has to be combined with recursion, recursion and backtracking are supposed to be in the same family

```python
class Solution:
    def traversal(self, cur, path, result):
        path.append(cur.val)  
        if not cur.left and not cur.right:  
            sPath = '->'.join(map(str, path))
            result.append(sPath)
            return
        if cur.left:  
            self.traversal(cur.left, path, result)
            path.pop()  
        if cur.right:  
            self.traversal(cur.right, path, result)
            path.pop()  
 
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root):
        result = []
        path = []
        if not root:
            return result
        self.traversal(root, path, result)
        return result
```



### Question 3

[404. Sum of Left Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/)

> Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.
>
> A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

Post-order traversal using recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return 0
        
        leftValue = self.sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left)  
        if root.left and not root.left.left and not root.left.right: 
            leftValue = root.left.val
            
        rightValue = self.sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right)  
 
        sum_val = leftValue + rightValue  
        return sum_val
```
