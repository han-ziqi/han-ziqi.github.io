excerpt: "It is my individual project. The perceptron is a simple neural network algorithm used for binary classification, which receives one or more inputs and produces a single output based on a weighted sum of the inputs. It has applications in various fields, such as image recognition and natural language processing. The project utilizes `Python` and several libraries such as `pandas` and `NumPy`. <br/><img src='https://github.com/han-ziqi/Perceptron/raw/master/demo/Perceptron.jpeg'>"

It is my individual project. The perceptron is a simple neural network algorithm used for binary classification, which receives one or more inputs and produces a single output based on a weighted sum of the inputs. It has applications in various fields, such as image recognition and natural language processing. The project utilizes `Python` and several libraries such as `pandas` and `NumPy`.

The standalone .py file including

1. implement a binary Perceptron

2. read and train train.data and discriminate between:
  - class 1 and class 2
  - class 2 and class 3
  - class 1 and class 3

3. Add L2-regularisation

Here is a demo for running result:
