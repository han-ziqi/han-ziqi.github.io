### For more information, you can [check this Repository in my Github](https://github.com/han-ziqi/dataExtract_getPolicy).

This is a data extraction program that can browse each sub-item from a given website, especially some news sites, and then save it.

The program's default extracted website is from [a policy announcement website](http://sousuo.gov.cn/s.htm?t=zhengcelibrary&q=).

After one complete run, this program can save approximately 7,000 pieces of data (early 2021 statistics) in about 85 minutes.

When running, a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) database will be created and the content will be stored by id, article title, post date, abstract, url, body, attachments. If the text contains any attachments, the program will also download the attachments automatically.

#### Here is a demo when running
