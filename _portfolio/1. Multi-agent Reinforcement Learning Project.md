This is my personal research project, utilizes the PyMARL framework to develop and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms. The project's technological stack comprises of Python and PyTorch.<br/>I show the influence of the relative overgeneralization pathology for the VDN and QMIX algorithms, a phenomenon where an agent's behavior becomes overly influenced by the actions of its teammates, leading to suboptimal decision-making. Then I modified these algorithm to address the pathology.
- VDN (Value-Decomposition Networks) is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that decomposes the centralized value function into a sum of individual value functions, enabling agents to make decentralized decisions. 
- QMIX (Q-value Mixing) is a variant of VDN that uses a monotonic mixing function to improve the performance of the algorithm.

This figure showes relative overgeneralization pathology in multiagent learning. (Wei and Luke, 2016)

- This project used PyMARL framework to setup environment Matrix Game and Predator Prey, allows multi-agent play games in these environments, to demonstrate the patholog.

This is a structure diagram for better understanding PyMARL

- In the experiments, I demonstrated that the two algorithms, VDN and QMIX, were indeed affected by RO.

The RO pathology occured when agents play Predator Prey game


I then made modifications to the two algorithms within this project. Finally relieved the RO pathology.
