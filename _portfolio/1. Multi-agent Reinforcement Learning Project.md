During the multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Process, it might be affected by a pathology called **relative overgeneralization (RO)**. In joint action space, when sub-optimal Nash equilibrium are more preferred than optimal Nash equilibrium, the pathology of RO may occur.

This figure showes relative overgeneralization pathology in multiagent learning. (Wei and Luke, 2016)

- This project used PyMARL framework to setup environment Matrix Game and Predator Prey, allows multi-agent play games in these environments, to demonstrate the patholog.

This is a structure diagram for better understanding PyMARL

- In the experiments, I demonstrated that the two algorithms, VDN and QMIX, were indeed affected by RO.

The RO pathology occured when agents play Predator Prey game


I then made modifications to the two algorithms within this project. Finally relieved the RO pathology.
