### For more information, you can [check this Repository in my Github](https://github.com/han-ziqi/K-Means-and-K-Medians).

- This project is a implementation about two **cluster algorithm** [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [K-Medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medians_clustering). 

- The **kmeans.py** can cluster words belonging to four files: *animals*, *countries*, *fruits* and *veggies*.
- The standalone .py file including:
  - Implement K-Means and K-Medians clustering algorithm
  - Vary K value from 1-9, then calculate the B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score for each set of clusters. Then plot the result.
  - Normalise each data object (vector) to unit l2 length before clustering, then re-run the algrithm and plot  B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score

You can see these demo

3. Vary K value, and Normalise each data object (vector) to unit l2 length before clustering, then compare and analysis
