This project was done by myself. In this project, I implemented two popular clustering algorithms, K-Means and K-Medians, for clustering words belonging to four different files. I vary the value of k, add l2 normalization before cluster, and evaluate the quality of the clustering using B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score. The results are then visualized through plots. The implementation is developed using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
- [K-Medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medians_clustering). 

- The **kmeans.py** can cluster words belonging to four files: *animals*, *countries*, *fruits* and *veggies*.
- The standalone .py file including:
  - Implement K-Means and K-Medians clustering algorithm
  - Vary K value from 1-9, then calculate the B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score for each set of clusters. Then plot the result.
  - Normalise each data object (vector) to unit l2 length before clustering, then re-run the algrithm and plot  B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score

You can see these demo

1. Demo for K-Means:

3. Vary K value, and Normalise each data object (vector) to unit l2 length before clustering, then compare and analysis
