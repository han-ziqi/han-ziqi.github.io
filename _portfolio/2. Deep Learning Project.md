### For more information, you can [check this Repository in my Github](https://github.com/han-ziqi/DeepLearning-openaigym).

In this project, I 
- Compared the [Q-learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) with the AC algorithm 
- Introduced the [A2C algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-actor-critic-methods-931b97b6df3f)
- Implemented the A2C algorithm and finish deep learning training.

The following figure shows the training process in the console:
