This is a deep reinforcement learning project that I worked with a group of 5 people. We implemented [Openai Gym's Lunar Lander-v2](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/), which aims to teach the agent to land a spacecraft on the moon using techniques. The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language and several libraries such as TensorFlow and NumPy. <br/>My role was collaborate with another to designed a deep neural network using TensorFlow, with multiple layers of convolutional and dense layers to enable the agent to learn features and patterns from the environment. This project offers a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience in deep learning, reinforcement learning and develop an understanding of how machine learning algorithms can solve complex real-world problems.

In this project, we
- Compared the [Q-learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) with the AC algorithm 
- Introduced the [A2C algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-actor-critic-methods-931b97b6df3f)
- Implemented the A2C algorithm and finish deep learning training.

The following figure shows the training process in the console:
