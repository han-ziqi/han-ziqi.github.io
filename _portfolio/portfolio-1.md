During the multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Process, it might be affected by a pathology called **relative overgeneralization (RO)**. In joint action space, when sub-optimal Nash equilibrium are more preferred than optimal Nash equilibrium, the pathology of RO may occur.

This project used PyMARL framework to setup environment Matrix Game and Predator Prey, allows multi-agent play games in these environments, to demonstrate the patholog.

In the experiments, I demonstrated that the two algorithms, VDN and QMIX, were indeed affected by RO. I then made modifications to the two algorithms within this project. Finally relieved the RO pathology.
