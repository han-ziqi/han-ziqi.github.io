Hi, sincere greetings from Ziqi. 

## Please feel free to explore my [Portfolio Page](https://han-ziqi.github.io/portfolio/) and [Teaching Page](https://han-ziqi.github.io/teaching/)

- I have recently completed my **Master of Science** in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/2023/advanced-computer-science-msc) with Merit at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk). Throughout my studies, I have gained comprehensive knowledge and expertise in core modules, including [Machine Learning and Bioinspired Optimisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP532_202223.htm), [Data Mining and Visualisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP527_202223.htm), [Multi-Agent Systems](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP310_202223.htm) and [Optimisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP557_202223.htm).
- My research has focus on Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning to address the pathology of "[Relative overgeneralisation](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-relative-overgeneralization-pathology-in-continuous-games_fig1_324793515)." I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Bei Peng](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/bei-peng/) throughout this research endeavour, and I am pleased to share that [my MSc project](https://github.com/han-ziqi/MARL-RO) was devoted to this topic. In addition, I have a keen interest in data science, and I am continually seeking new opportunities to immerse myself in this exciting and dynamic field. I have completed a number of projects related to DL/RL/Data mining, which can be found in my [Portfolio Page](https://han-ziqi.github.io/portfolio/). 
- I had the honour of serving as a **Teaching Assistant** in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/) at the University of Liverpool (October 2021 - July 2022). During this time, I assisted with a total of four undergraduate modules (Level 4 and 5 FHEQ). My involvement in the [Foundations in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (FLTHE)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/eddev/supporting-teaching/flthe/) program further attests to my commitment to excellence in the teaching profession,  and gain professional recognition as **Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)**. Further information on my teaching can be found on my [Teaching Page](https://han-ziqi.github.io/teaching/).
- Prior to my Master's degree, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from [Shanxi Agricultural University](https://www.sxau.edu.cn). My undergraduate studies provided me with an extensive understanding of computers, encompassing **foundational computer modules** such as Data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Software Project Management, and Computer Networks, as well as **Frontend and Backend web development** using technologies such as HTML, CSS, DIV, Spring, Maven, JSP, query, Mybatis+JDBC, and others.
