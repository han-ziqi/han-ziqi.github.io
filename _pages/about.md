Hi, sincere greetings from Ziqi. 

- I am recent graduated **Master** student. I was awarded the degree of **Master of Science** in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/2023/advanced-computer-science-msc) with Merit from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk). Core modules are [Machine Learning and Bioinspired Optimisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP532_202223.htm), [Data Mining and Visualisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP527_202223.htm), [Multi-Agent Systems](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP310_202223.htm) and [Optimisation](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/COMP557_202223.htm) etc.
- My research focus on Machine Learning, My MSc Project was a research about Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning pathology called "Relative overgeneralisation", supervised by [Dr Bei Peng](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/bei-peng/) at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk). And I have completed a deep learning project from [OpenAi Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). You can view some of my screenshots, as well as the results of the experiment. In addition, I am very happy to immerse myself in the data science world. I finished a project using clustering algorithms such as [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)/[K-Medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medians_clustering) to cluster the instances into k clusters, and calculate B-CUBED precision, recall, and F-score. This is very useful for identifying patterns and trends.I also independently developed a data extraction project during my internship
- TA
- I received my **Bachelor of Engineering** in **Software Engineering** from [Shanxi Agricultural University](https://www.sxau.edu.cn). Here, I completed a systematic study of computers from **Basic computer knowledge** including Data structures, Object Oriented Programming, Software Project Management, Computer Network,  etc. to **Frontend and Backend web development** including The Basis of WebPage Design(HTML+CSS+DIV), Spring, Maven, JSP, query, Mybatis+JDBC etc.
