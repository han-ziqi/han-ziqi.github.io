Hi, I'm Ziqi. 

- I am recent graduated **Master** student. I received my MSc degree in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/2023/advanced-computer-science-msc) from the University of Liverpool. My Msc Project was a research about Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning pathology called "Relative overgeneralisation", supervised by [Dr Bei Peng](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/bei-peng/).
